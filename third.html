    <h3>Colin Leary</h3>

    <p>
    Hi, my name is Colin Leary. I’ve always strived to attain a deeper level of understanding surrounding human geography. Understanding Political boundaries, and what causes them, is undoubtedly at the forefront of this endeavor. Ever since I was old enough to understand elections, I’ve harbored a disdain for the mentality of alienating political opponents. Instead, I believe in taking a closer look at what socio-economic and geographic factors have carved out this divide in our country’s politics. I’ve adopted mapping software as a tool to understand why people think and act in the ways they do. We need not homogenize our beliefs, but allow ourselves to understand how similar we all truly are. I believe information and data mapping is the most effective method for achieving this, and achieving a stronger, more determined nation.

    <h3>Noah Warren</h3>

    <p>
    Hi, my name is Noah Warren. Throughout my life I’ve been fascinated by politics and government.  At the age of 5, I became obsessed with knowing everything about US Presidents. I even took it upon myself to memorize all 43 concurrent presidents. My fascination continued into COVID where I filled notebooks out with details about each Presidential Election, and major pieces of legislation passed during their term. Since 2017, I’ve worked alongside the Vice Mayor of Alexandria, providing a deeper understanding of our political system. It was then that I grew to love politics and government. At Election Preview, I want to display this passion to the world.
